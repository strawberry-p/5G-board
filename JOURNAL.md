# June 5th - Started designing
The roadtrip call finally gave me motivation to start. I quickly sketched out some "extra" features I want on my keyboard (compared to a typical commercial split keeb) to see how many rows and columns/additional pins I will need. After that, I made a key matrix for the left half of the keyboard. I also looked into sourcing wireless MCUs, so far it looks like an ESP32-S3 board would be a good choice.

**Total time spent: about 2 hours**
