# June 5th - Started designing
The roadtrip call finally gave me motivation to start. I quickly sketched out some "extra" features I want on my keyboard (compared to a typical commercial split keeb) to see how many rows and columns/additional pins I will need. After that, I made a key matrix for the left half of the keyboard. I also looked into sourcing wireless MCUs, so far it looks like an ESP32-S3 board would be a good choice.

# June 12th - Part research
I came back from a trip and decided to look into extra parts for my keyboard. I´m going to add an analog stick for mouse controlling (I tend to forget my mouse sometimes, so this will come in useful :P). I found some joysticks in a local electronics shop for less than a dollar each, but i´m not sure about their quality. I also decided against using a TRRS connector for connecting the halves - it´s pretty and pretty small, but i´m very forgetful and would probably end up shorting it from unplugging. I am still indecisive on whether to go for a USB-C cable (with IIC or something like that run on the D+ and D- lines), or something like a 4P4C connector.
